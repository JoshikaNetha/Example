    <p>An HTML document is a file containing hypertext 
        markup language. HTML code is based on tags, or hidden keywords, 
        which provide instructions for formatting the document. A tag starts 
        with an angle bracket and the 'less than' sign: '<'. The tag ends 
        with an angle bracket and the 'greater than' sign '>'. Tags tell the 
        processing program, often the web browser, what to do with the text.</p>
