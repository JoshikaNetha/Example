        Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming 
        language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, 
        Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable 
        use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and 
        object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, 
        logical code for small and large-scale projects.
