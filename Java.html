        Java is a programming language and computing platform first 
        released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of 
        applications and websites that will not work unless you 
        have Java installed, and more are created every day. 
        Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, 
        game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the 
        Internet, Java is everywhere
